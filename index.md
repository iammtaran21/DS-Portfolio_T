# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Linear_Reg)

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**54%** accuracy](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/Linear_Reg/Linear_Regression_Project_T%20(1).ipynb) .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_PROJECT)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Classifying Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients based on provided Features to decrease the time required for finding a diagonasis.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**95%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/Logistic_PROJECT/Logistic_Project_T%20(2).ipynb) .

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Knn_NB)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Amazon Fine Food Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/NLP)

<img src="images/amazon.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.
