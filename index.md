# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Sarcasm Detection of tweets using Transformers Deep learning model ](https://github.com/iammtaran21/TF/blob/main/I_Sarcasm_Transformers_TF.ipynb)

<img src="images/tweets.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, NLP

**Project Objective:** Detecting Sarcasm in tweets using NLP and Deep learning.

**Quantifiable result:** We could detect Sarcasm on test tweets resulting in [**70.64%** accuracy](https://github.com/iammtaran21/TF/blob/main/I_Sarcasm_Transformers_TF.ipynb) .

- Used BERT to detect sarcasm in tweets
- The I- Sarcasm dataset was used.
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Examining the effectsssss of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Linear_Reg)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**54%** accuracy](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/Linear_Reg/Linear_Regression_Project_T%20(1).ipynb) .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_PROJECT)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Classifying Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients based on provided Features to decrease the time required for finding a diagonasis.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**95%** accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/Logistic_PROJECT/Logistic_Project_T%20(2).ipynb) .

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/Knn_NB)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbor, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbour points . 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an [**accuracy** of 80%](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/Knn_NB/KNN_NB_Project_T.ipynb) .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Amazon Fine Food Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/tree/main/NLP)

<img src="images/amazon.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, TfidVectorizer 

**Project Objective:** Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative based on Amazon foods . 

**Quantifiable result:** We could We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is neutral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) [**AUC** Score of 88%](https://github.com/iammtaran21/DS_Projects/blob/main/NLP/NLP_Project.ipynb) .

- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.
